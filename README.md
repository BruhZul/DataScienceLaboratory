### Laboratory 1

Taking into account the contracts that have been activated and the contracts that have been extended in Lombardy, I will try to answer the following question:
- Which group of people (citizienship, age, sex, level of education) was the most successful at getting its own contract extended?

My experiment is explained and showed in the Jupyter notebook `Final.ipynb`, but there is also a different notebooks (in the `Preproc` folder) in which I show how I modified the original dataset in order to use them for the experiment. 
In the `Datasets` folder there will be a readme file with a link to the datasets that I used and their sources.

In order to replicate the experiment it is sufficient to download the transformed datasets, indicate in the `Final` notebook the path in which they are stored, and then execute the following istructions. This way there is no need to actually execute the notebooks in the `Preproc` folder and it can just be read. Considering the size of the original datasets, this saves some time.

In alternative, it is of course possible to start from the `Preproc` folder and obtain the trasformed datasets from there.

I used Python 3.8.12
